(2, 'Covid-19', 'Coronaviruses are a family of viruses that can cause illnesses such as the common cold, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS). In 2019, a new coronavirus was identified as the cause of a disease outbreak that originated in China.  The virus is known as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The disease it causes is called coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). In March 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the COVID-19 outbreak a pandemic.  Public health groups, including the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and WHO, are monitoring the COVID-19 pandemic and posting updates on their websites. These groups have also issued recommendations for preventing and treating the virus that causes COVID-19.'),
(3, 'Chickenpox', 'Chickenpox is an infection caused by the varicella-zoster virus. It causes an itchy rash with small, fluid-filled blisters. Chickenpox is highly contagious to people who haven\'t had the disease or been vaccinated against it. Today, a vaccine is available that protects children against chickenpox. Routine vaccination is recommended by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).\r\n\r\nThe chickenpox vaccine is a safe, effective way to prevent chickenpox and its possible complications.'),
(4, 'Dengue', 'Dengue (DENG-gey) fever is a mosquito-borne illness that occurs in tropical and subtropical areas of the world. Mild dengue fever causes a high fever and flu-like symptoms. The severe form of dengue fever, also called dengue hemorrhagic fever, can cause serious bleeding, a sudden drop in blood pressure (shock) and death.\r\n\r\nMillions of cases of dengue infection occur worldwide each year. Dengue fever is most common in Southeast Asia, the western Pacific islands, Latin America and Africa. But the disease has been spreading to new areas, including local outbreaks in Europe and southern parts of the United States.\r\n\r\nResearchers are working on dengue fever vaccines. For now, in areas where dengue fever is common, the best ways to prevent infection are to avoid being bitten by mosquitoes and to take steps to reduce the mosquito population'),
(5, 'Flu', 'Flu (influenza) is an infection of the nose, throat and lungs, which are part of the respiratory system. Influenza is commonly called the flu, but it\'s not the same as stomach \"flu\" viruses that cause diarrhea and vomiting.\r\n\r\nMost people with the flu get better on their own. But sometimes, influenza and its complications can be deadly. People at higher risk of developing flu complications include:\r\n\r\nYoung children under age 2\r\nAdults older than age 65\r\nResidents of nursing homes and other long-term care facilities\r\nPeople who are pregnant or plan to be pregnant during flu season\r\nPeople with weakened immune systems\r\nAmerican Indians or Alaska Natives\r\nPeople who have chronic illnesses, such as asthma, heart disease, kidney disease, liver disease and diabetes\r\nPeople with a body mass index (BMI) of 40 or higher\r\nAlthough the annual influenza vaccine isn\'t 100% effective, it reduces the chances of having severe complications from infection.'),
(6, 'Hepatitis A', 'Hepatitis A is a highly contagious liver infection caused by the hepatitis A virus. The virus is one of several types of hepatitis viruses that cause liver inflammation and affect your liver\'s ability to function.\r\n\r\nYou\'re most likely to get hepatitis A from contaminated food or water or from close contact with a person or object that\'s infected. Mild cases of hepatitis A don\'t require treatment. Most people who are infected recover completely with no permanent liver damage.\r\n\r\nPracticing good hygiene, including washing hands frequently, can prevent the spread of the virus. The hepatitis A vaccine can protect against hepatitis A.'),
(7, 'Hepatitis B', 'Hepatitis B is a serious liver infection caused by the hepatitis B virus (HBV). For most people, hepatitis B is short term, also called acute, and lasts less than six months. But for others, the infection becomes chronic, meaning it lasts more than six months. Having chronic hepatitis B increases your risk of developing liver failure, liver cancer or cirrhosis â€” a condition that permanently scars the liver.\r\n\r\nMost adults with hepatitis B recover fully, even if their symptoms are severe. Infants and children are more likely to develop a long-lasting hepatitis B infection. This is known as a chronic infection.\r\n\r\nA vaccine can prevent hepatitis B, but there\'s no cure if you have the condition. If you\'re infected, taking certain precautions can help prevent spreading the virus to others.'),
(8, 'Polio', 'Polio is a contagious viral illness that in its most severe form causes nerve injury leading to paralysis, difficulty breathing and sometimes death.\r\n\r\nIn the U.S., the last case of naturally occurring polio was in 1979. Today, despite a worldwide effort to wipe out polio, poliovirus continues to affect children and adults in parts of Asia and Africa.\r\n\r\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) advises taking precautions to protect yourself from polio if you\'re traveling anywhere there\'s a risk of polio.\r\n\r\nAdults who have been vaccinated who plan to travel to an area where polio is occurring should receive a booster dose of inactivated poliovirus vaccine (IPV). Immunity after a booster lasts a lifetime.');

Greater stress is being laid on public-private partnerships and preventive work notably in the Paediatrics department to avert unnecessary infant and child deaths due to pneumonia, malnutrition, diarrhea or vaccine-preventable illnesses. Measures are also in place to prevent and control major communicable diseases such as Tuberculosis, Malaria, viral Hepatitis B & C and HIV/AIDS, in addition to non-communicable diseases such as cardiovascular diseases, diabetes and cancers having a huge burden in Pakistan. Today as Karachi is a sprawling mega-city with a population estimated at 18 million divided into 18 major towns, the Civil Hospital Karachi lives on to tell two tales in the same city. The services of this tertiary care institution have kept in line with the latest technological advances as far as that is compatible with the situation in a low-income developing country. Sophisticated laboratory and radiographical procedures, investigations and examinations are performed totally free to benefit the poor patients attending the hospital.
